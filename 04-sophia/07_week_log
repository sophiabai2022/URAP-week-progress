## Tasks
1. Create a diagram expressing the relationships among different variables in opa deworming

## Reports
1. [Sample Diagram for variables in Approach 1](https://github.com/sophiabai2022/URAP-week-progress/blob/master/04-sophia/Week%206/Var%20Relationships.Rmd)

  - potential problems:
    - C = DC (direct cost) + IC (indirect cost); there is function for DC but no function for IC
    - lambda 1 has a function, but lambda 2 does not
    - equation of w_t, what are variables I suppose to put in?
    - walkthrough of the equations and the diagrams to make sure there's no confusions
